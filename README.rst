History
=======

This repo was originally clone from here::

  $ git clone https://github.com/smanek/trivial-lisp-webapp.git

With a description of how to get it running here: `A Simple-Lisp Webapp for Beginners`_.

The original author also provided this note:

  This is meant to be be a simple 'base' that you can use to develop your own
  Lisp Webapp. The startup script (``startserver.sh``) expects SBCL to be
  installed and in your PATH, but besides that there are no external
  dependencies.

Changes from the Original
=========================

The following changes have been made:

* Addition of a ``Makefile`` and removal of the ``startserver.sh`` script.

*
